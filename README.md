Problem Statement: Optimizing Employee Retention through Predictive Analytics in Human Resources
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Resources are critical resources of any organization. Organizations spend a huge amount of time and money to hire and nurture their employees. The area of employee retention presents a significant opportunity for improvement, but is currently hindered by the challenge of rising employee attrition rates and the inability to proactively identify at-risk employees. This challenge leads to significant financial losses due to increased costs of recruitment, hiring, and training replacements, as well as reduced production and profitability within industries. Existing approaches to address this problem often rely on reactive measures or generalized HR practices, which may lack the precision and foresight needed for optimal outcomes in retaining key talent. There is a pressing need to leverage available data to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company in order to develop strategies that effectively mitigate these issues and unlock new value. By developing a robust, data-driven solution, we aim to transform HR employee retention management, leading to more effective talent management, reduced attrition costs, and enhanced organizational productivity and profitability.
